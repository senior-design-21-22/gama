    "Artificial intelligence is a course that looks at current uses of Artificial intelligence systems and how they are implemented today. In this course you will get a better understanding of what Artificial intelligence and how it has evolved over time. You will look at different ways Artificial intelligence been used to solve problems and puzzles. You will get a better understand of how to characterize problems and how you could come up with different heuristics to solve them. You will see a variety of Artificial intelligence systems/approaches in this course such as Backtracking, Graph searches, Algorithm A*,  evaluation of heuristics, Production systems, Search Strategies for Decomposable Production Systems, Game playing, Predicate Calculus, Rules of Inference, Resolution, Rule Based Deduction Systems and much more."

    "Algorithm A* is an informed search algorithm for path finding. This algorithm uses a heuristic path cost the starting point’s cost, and the ending point to find the optimal path. This means that it will look at the lowst cost or shortst (length) path to a certin node as well as a predicted cost of how close a node might be to the end of the path.\n",

    "h  (n) : The actual cost path from the current node to goal node.\n",

    "n : The next node in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a walk through an iteration.\n",
    "If we are searching for node E and we have already searched B we will then need to cacluate the f values of all of the nodes that are initaly connected to any of the nodes we have already searched, so in this case we will search D E and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets calculate the f value of node D.\n",
    "g(n) would be the total cost of travling to a current node so if we wanted a g value of D and we have already travled to B then the g value of D would be 4 due to the 1 cost from A to B and then 3 cost from B to D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will want to get our informed heuristic value of D. This will come from a certain heursitic function that will hopefully give us a good prediction to determin if going to certain node will be better for our path or not. The heuristic could calculated in a varity of differnt ways and you can use differnt heuristics for different problems. In our example we will initaly keep all of heurisitc the same and use the value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we add the two together to get 5 as our f value. We will then get the f values of C and E wich will be 7, and 10. Now becuase D is the lowst f value we will proceed to that node and continue the processes until we reach our desired node.\n",
