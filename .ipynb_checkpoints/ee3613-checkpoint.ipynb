    "## **What You'll Learn**\n",
    "Three important topics covered in EE 3613 include computer performance, coding in an instruction set architecture language, and computer arithmetic. Important computer performance concepts include formulas relating clock cycles, clock rate, CPI, CPU execution time, and more. \"MIPS\" is an example of an instruction set architecture, in which you will learn how to code in. An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software. The ISA acts as an interface between the hardware and the software, specifying both what the processor is capable of doing as well as how it gets done. Finally, you will learn how a computer performs arithmetic - including storing numbers in 2's compliment form.\n",
    "### **Computer Performance**\n",
    "The formulas listed below are important in determining the performance of a computer.\n",
    "- Performance(x) = 1 / CPU Execution Time(x)\n",
    "- CPU Execution Time = Number CPU Clock Cycles · Clock Cycle Time\n",
    "- CPU Execution Time = Number CPU Clock Cycles / Clock Rate\n",
    "- Number CPU Clock Cycles = Number Instructions · Average Clock Cycles Per Instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:** Your program runs in 24 seconds on computer A which runs at a 2.7GHz clock rate. Suppose you want to be able to run this program in 14 seconds on a new computer B, which is able to run at a higher clock rate but requires 1.3 times as many clock cycles as computer A for the same program. Using the formulas above, calculate the clock rate for computer B.\n"

    "Two's complement is the most common method of representing signed integers on computers, and more generally, fixed point binary values. In two's complement notation, a non-negative number is represented by its ordinary binary representation; in this case, the most significant bit is 0. Though, the range of numbers represented is not the same as with unsigned binary numbers. For example, an 8-bit unsigned number can represent the values 0 to 255 (11111111). However, a two's complement 8-bit number can only represent positive integers from 0 to 127 (01111111), because the rest of the bit combinations with the most significant bit as '1' represent the negative integers −1 to −128. To represent a POSITIVE decimal number in two's complement, convert the decimal number to binary. To represent a NEGATIVE decimal number in two's complement, there are three steps. First, convert the decimal number to binary. Next, invert each digit in that binary number. Finally, add one, and that is your answer."

    "EE 3613 is an important class within OU's computer science curriculum. In this class, you will learn powerful lower-level coding concepts, as illustrated in the 4 examples above. The ISA provides the only way through which a user is able to interact with the hardware. It can be viewed as a programmer’s manual because it’s the portion of the machine that’s visible to the assembly language programmer, the compiler writer, and the application programmer. You will also learn about pipelines, hazard detection, among other concepts related to a computer's hardware."
