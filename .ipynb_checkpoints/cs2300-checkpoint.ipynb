    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "CS 2300 - Computer Programming in Java is a stand-alone course in the computer science cirriculum here at Ohio University intended for students who want to learn more about computer programming for their use in unrelated fields. Meaning CS 2300 is not a required course for computer science majors, but rather for students in other majors who want to further their skills in computer programming. As a student in this course you will learn the basics of programming in Java, representing data, debugging and verifying programs, and also dive into the organization and charactersitics of computers. If you're not sure if you want to declare computer science as your major right away, this would be the perfect first class to take to learn more about the basics of computer programming and much more computing related topics."

    ">>> - **Identity**: The identity of an object is represented by the unique name given to that object upon declaration. This uniqueness enables one object to interact with other objects."

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "This course gives a well rounded introduction to both java and computer programming as a whole. Accessable to any student who is interested, this class is not unique to computer science majors. As discussed briefly in this module we approach fundamental topics within java such as Classes, Objects, and Methods in java while also touching into Constructors, getters, and setters. All of these combine for a great foundational understanding of what to expect in a CS course while being done in a beginner friendly language such as java. The course will follow on to the topics discussed and it can be expected to learn more about graphical user interfaces and basic control structure which are essential to learn development in any new language.
