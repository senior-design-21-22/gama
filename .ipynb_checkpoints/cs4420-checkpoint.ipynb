    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "In this class we cover in-depth coverage of computer operating systems and related computer architecture issues. Coverage of physical devices, interrupts, and communication between the computer and external hardware. Interfaces between user programs and the operating system, system calls, software interrupts, and protection issues. Context switching, process address spaces, and process scheduling. Process synchronization, inter-process communications, critical sections, and deadlock detection and recovery. Memory mapping, swapping, paging, and virtual memory."

    "An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. While also communicating with the computer without having to speak the computer's language. Above we reviewed how to use the OS to make and remove directories, how to return CPU memory modules, and how to output your computers CPU and memory information. Also we approached the critical section problem which is essential in ensuring that the code is interpreted by the OS correctly. These are fundamental topics that together give a good representation of what can be expected in the course. "
