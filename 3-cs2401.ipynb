    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "CS 2401 will be a continuation of the programming that you will learn about in CS 2400, but with a concentration on the development of larger projects and the design process. In this class, you will be looking at the different ways that classes can hold data in ways that are versatile and useful, including dynamic arrays, linked lists, and inheritance - which is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming. Other topics  include design of software using UML, generic programming (templates), stacks, queues, container classes and iterators, derived classes, and virtual functions. During the final weeks of this class, you will be developing a single big project, which will be some type of board game.  This will be a program where the computer will play an “intelligent” game against a human opponent. It will be while you are working on your game that you will also learn about recursion and binary trees."

    "### **Binary Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a binary tree is a special kind of data structure used to store data in an efficient way. Each 'node' in a binary tree contains a value, and has pointers containing values of two children - a left child, and a right child. In a binary search tree, the left child's value is less than its parent, and the right child's value is greater than its parent. Binary search trees are a type of binary tree used for sorting and searching numbers in a quick way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a self-sorting binary tree implemented in Python. Modify the numbers in the tree.add() statements at the bottom to see if the tree will put the numbers in a sorted order."

Each time a recursive function is called, that function call is placed on the run time call stack.\n",
