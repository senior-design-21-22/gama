    "\n",
    "This is a hands-on introduction to the science of programming and programming languages. This class includes many topics such as: structured data and pattern-matching, recursive and polymorphic data, recursion and higher-order functions, lazy evaluation and streams, automated and equational reasoning about programs, concrete and abstract syntax, grammars, interpreters, desugaring, types and type-checking, type safety, mutable state, references, and objects. Over the course of the semester, you will build interpreters and type checkers for a series of increasingly complex languages. We will cover just a few of these topics in this notebook."

    "Recursion is a concept in computer science where a function will call itself. Down below we can see a factorial function that calculates the factorial of a given number. In the beginning of the function we have conditional statement where if satisfied will not call the function again, and terminate the function, this is called the base case. In our case the base case is the n == 1 and returning 1. In a recursive function if we don’t have a base case then the function will get stuck in a loop of calling itself over and over. If we are not in our base case we can then start the calculation of the factorial by taking the current number and multiplying it by the factorial of the number 1 smaller than it which we can do by calling factorial on the smaller number."
