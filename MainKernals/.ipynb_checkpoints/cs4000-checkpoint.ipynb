    "\n",
    "CS 4000 - Intro to Distributed, Parallel, and Web-Centric Computing is one of the most interesting courses in the CS core cirriculum here at Ohio University. In this course you will learn about several interesting topics involving parallel and distributed computing like threading, synchronization, and potential speedup of programs. CS 4000 is a very project-based course so throughout the semester you will get plenty of hands-on learning involving the topics you will eventually learn about in lecture. Because you will be developing parallel and distributed programs on your own in this course, another essential topic you will learn about is how to calculate and optimize the efficency of your programs. Developing and optimizing programs to be as efficient as possible is a key skill you will develop in this course. Altogether, this course will definetly make you think about optimization more than you ever have before, and allow you to utilize the hardware behind the scenes to create lightning fast programs."

From there we are going to cover how we can calculate the efficiency of the parallel program, and also calculate the potential speed-up. However, speed-up has certain limitations - as described with Amdahl’s Law and Gustafson’s Law."

    "\n",
    "C++ threads are a built-in library in the C++ language that supports multi-platform shared-memory multithreading programming in C++. What this technically means is that we can use functionality from the C++ Threads library to create C++ programs that run in parallel. A program that runs in parallel utilizes multiple computer processesors to simoultaneously carry out the calculations of a program. Instead of a normal program that only uses one of your computer's processors, a parallel program can use several at the same time! We can use C++ Threads to develop our C++ programs, and the program will tell the machine the program is running on to run it in parallel using multiple threads. Checkout the example below!"

    "If you run the above code block multiple times, you will see that the order in which each thread executes varies every time. This is because the threads are pretty unpredictable in this way. If you were to go further and break up a set of computations or calcluations, you could assign a specific set of those computations to certain threads and bring them altogether at the end to make the program execute the computations in parallel. The beauty behind this dynamic of parallelism is breaking up work into sections or 'threads', so they can execute at the same time and ultimatley speed up the program by a substantial amount."

In those cases, the value of S limits the performance enhancements that can be made when applying multiple processors to the same system.\n",

Gustafson law assumes that, on a sequential machine, there is a fixed sequential component (s) and a component that can be executed in parallel (p), where s + p = 1. When the program scale to N processors, s remains the same, whereas p is performed on all N processors. So, the scaled speedup according to Gustafson's Law is: \n",
