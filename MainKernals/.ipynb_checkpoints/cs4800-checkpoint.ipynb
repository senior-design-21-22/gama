    "## **Course Description:**\n",
    "Artificial intelligence is a course that looks at current uses of Artificial intelligence systems and how they are implemented today. In this course you will get a better understanding of what Artificial intelligence and how it has evolved over time. You will look at different ways Artificial intelligence been used to solve problems and puzzles. You will get a better understand of how to characterize problems and how you could come up with different heuristics to solve them. You will see a variety of Artificial intelligence systems/approaches in this course such as Backtracking, Graph searches, Algorithm A*,  evaluation of heuristics, Production systems, Search Strategies for Decomposable Production Systems, Game playing, Predicate Calculus, Rules of Inference, Resolution, Rule Based Deduction Systems and much more."

    "### **Algorithm A***\n",
    "Algorithm A* is an informed search algorithm for path finding. This algorithm uses a heuristic path cost the starting point’s cost, and the ending point to find the optimal path. This means that it will look at the lowest cost or shortest (length) path to a certain node as well as a predicted cost of how close a node might be to the end of the path.\n",

    "f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n",

    "h  (n) : The actual cost path from the current node to goal node.\n",

    "n : The next node in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a walk through an iteration.\n",
    "If we are searching for node E and we have already searched B we will then need to calculate the f values of all the nodes that are initially connected to any of the nodes we have already searched, so in this case we will search D E and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s calculate the f value of node D.\n",
    "g(n) would be the total cost of traveling to a current node so if we wanted a g value of D and we have already traveled to B then the g value of D would be 4 due to the 1 cost from A to B and then 3 cost from B to D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will want to get our informed heuristic value of D. This will come from a certain heuristic function that will hopefully give us a good prediction to determine if going to certain node will be better for our path or not. The heuristic could be calculated in a variety of different ways, and you can use different heuristics for different problems. In our example we will initially keep all of heuristic the same and use the value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we add the two together to get 5 as our f value. We will then get the f values of C and E which will be 7, and 10. Now because D is the lowest f value we will proceed to that node and continue the processes until we reach our desired node.\n",
