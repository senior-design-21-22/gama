    "This course will teach you about Data Structures, the algoritms associated with them, and analysis of the algorithms themselves. Topics discussed within the class include algorithm analysis, dynamic arrays, tree structures, heaps, balanced trees, dictionaries, and complexity sorting. Once students recieve a core understanding of Data Structures, built in algorithms and structures are introduced in modern programming languages. CS 3610 provides a foundation that can be used within every class within the computer science curriculum. Throughout the course there will be plenty of projects and a weekly lab which will allow you to implement the information learned within lecture. Here we will implement a dynamic array and an insertion sort which will give a brief introduction to the topics discussed. "

    "CS 3610 expands upon your C++ knowledge. Sometimes, when using an array to store data, you will need to be able to add or remove elements in it. Our first example discusses how to do this with something called a dynamic array. Afterwards, we discuss insertion sort, a specific type of sorting algorithm. Finally, you will be introduced to time complexity - are certain algorithms better (faster) than others?"

    "A dynamic array is similar to an array, but with the difference that its size can be dynamically modified at runtime. Don’t need to specify how much large an array beforehand. The elements of an array occupy a contiguous block of memory, and once created, its size cannot be changed. A dynamic array can, once the array is filled, allocate a bigger chunk of memory, copy the contents from the original array to this new space, and continue to fill the available slots.\n",

    "A Binary Search Tree is a data structure where all the nodes in each tree follow two main rules. One being the value of the key of the left sub-tree is less than the value of its parent (root) node's key. The second rule is that the value of the key of the right sub-tree is greater than or equal to the value of its parent (root) node's key. Binary search trees allow for a quick binary search of certain nodes which is used for fast searching, inserting, and removal of data items.\n",

In this class you will learn how to build an AVL Tree which is type of binary tree that will be able to balance itself as you build it, which will help you keep a quicker worst case search time when searching for a desired node."
