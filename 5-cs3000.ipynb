    "In this course you will learn about Discrete Mathematics and its application to computer science. This will include propositional logic, number theory and proofs, sequences, and mathematical induction, set theory, counting and combinatorics, discrete probability, functions, recursion, simple analysis of algorithms, and orderings and relations. We will cover a couple of these topics in this notebook. We will be looking at set theory and inductive proofs."

    "Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies set which can be described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole. In computer science we can look at these techniques to help us see what’s similar and what’s different between sets. Below are some python code snippets that describe some of the set theory attributes. Feel free to change around the list to see what output will be produced after changing them."
